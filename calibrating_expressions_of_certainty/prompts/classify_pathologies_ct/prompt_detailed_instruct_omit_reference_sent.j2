Act as an expert radiologist, extract common pathologies from radiology reports as follows.

Each row contains EXACTLY two strings in double quotes separated by comma:
1. one pathology name, such as "atelectasis", "aspiration", "pneumonia", "pulmonary edema", "pleural effusion", "pneumothorax", "fibrosis" etc.
2. the confidence that the pathology is present, such as "absent", "possible", "may", "likely", "present" etc.

Here are a few examples:
{% for example in examples %}
##### REPORT:
{{ example.report }}
{% if example.pathologies %}
##### ANSWER:
{%- for pathology in example.pathologies %}
- "{{ pathology.pathology }}", "{{ pathology.confidence }}"
{%- endfor %}
#####
{%- else %}
##### ANSWER:
{%- endif %}
{% endfor %}
