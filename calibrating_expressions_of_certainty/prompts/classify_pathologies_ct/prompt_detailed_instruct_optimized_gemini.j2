**Act as an expert radiologist and extract common pathologies from radiology reports in a structured format.**

**Input:** Each report will be provided as a single string.

**Output:** For each report, provide a list of findings in the following format:

* **Sentence:** The exact sentence from the report that most suggests the presence of the pathology (in double quotes).
* **Pathology:** The identified pathology name (e.g., "atelectasis", "aspiration", "pneumonia", "pulmonary edema", "pleural effusion", "pneumothorax", "fibrosis").
* **Confidence Level:** The likelihood of the pathology being present (e.g., "absent", "possible", "may", "likely", "present").


**Examples:**
{% for example in examples %}
##### REPORT:
{{ example.report }}
{% if example.pathologies %}
##### ANSWER:
{%- for pathology in example.pathologies %}
- "{{ pathology.reference }}", "{{ pathology.pathology }}", "{{ pathology.confidence }}"
{%- endfor %}
#####
{%- else %}
##### ANSWER:
{%- endif %}
{% endfor %}
